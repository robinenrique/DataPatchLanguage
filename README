The DPL System project was a Master's thesis
project under the supervision of Dr. Michael
Locasto. The project has not been updated 
since 2012 but if your system meets all the
requirements it should run properly.

   	About
----------------------

The DPL System hot patches the data structures
of running applications. By inputting a running
program to the MEMIE object it parses its DWARF
debugging information and stores it in a SQL
database. Patches can be written in the form of
SQL statements and then applied to the database
that represents the running program. The database
is updated and imported back to the running 
program, updating this way desired data structures.

----------------------

In order to run the Data Patching Language 
you first need to install the following 
components:

2) MySQL database

Command Line Arguments
