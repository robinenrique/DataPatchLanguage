MemSniff is a tool for observing the memory events of x86 Linux
programs from userspace.

The 'memsniff' script runs the software. The code is released under
the GNU GPL v2. Source is included, as well as a binary version of the
software and the Pin runtime environment compiled for gcc 3.4.  

This software has been tested on an i686 Fedora Core 3 machine with
3.4.4 20050721 (Red Hat 3.4.4-2) running kernel 2.6.12-1.1381_FC3.
