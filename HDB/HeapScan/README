HeapScan is a tool for parsing the heap of x86 Linux programs into
collections of data structures.

The 'heapscan' script runs the software. The code is released under
the GNU GPL v2. Source is included, as well as a binary version of the
software and the Pin runtime environment compiled for gcc 4.3.x.

This software has been tested on an i686 Fedora Core 10 machine with
gcc 4.3.2 20081105 (Red Hat 4.3.2-7) running kernel
2.6.27.19-170.2.35.fc10.
